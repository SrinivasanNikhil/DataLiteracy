Object orientation is the concept that imagines the variable elements within a script to be comprised of objects. The power of this concept is that objects can be reused and have attributes and functions/methods that can be performed on them. For instance, a car can be an object and every such object as attributes like make, model and engine size. Car objects also have functions/methods or things that can be done on them such as accelerate, brake, etc. \n",
